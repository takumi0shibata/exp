## **Score 3**
The reader can understand the main ideas, although they may be overly broad or simplistic, and the results may not be effective. Supporting detail is often limited, insubstantial, overly general, or occasionally slightly off-topic. The writing is characterized by:
- an easily identifiable purpose and main idea(s).
- predictable or overly-obvious main ideas; or points that echo observations heard elsewhere; or a close retelling of another work.
- support that is attempted, but developmental details are often limited, uneven, somewhat off-topic, predictable, or too general (e.g., a list of underdeveloped points).
- details that may not be well-grounded in credible resources; they may be based on clichés, stereotypes or questionable sources of information.
- difficulties when moving from general observations to specifics.

## **Score 2**
Main ideas and purpose are somewhat unclear or development is attempted but minimal. The writing is characterized by:
- a purpose and main idea(s) that may require extensive inferences by the reader.
- minimal development; insufficient details.
- irrelevant details that clutter the text.
- extensive repetition of detail.

## **Score 1**
The writing lacks a central idea or purpose. The writing is characterized by:
- ideas that are extremely limited or simply unclear.
- attempts at development that are minimal or nonexistent; the paper is too short to demonstrate the development of an idea.
