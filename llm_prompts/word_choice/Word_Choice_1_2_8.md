Language lacks precision and variety, or may be inappropriate to audience and purpose in places. The writer does not employ a variety of words, producing a sort of “generic” paper filled with familiar words and phrases. The writing is characterized by:
- words that work, but that rarely capture the reader’s interest.
- expression that seems mundane and general; slang, if used, does not seem purposeful and is not effective.
- attempts at colorful language that seem overdone or forced.
- words that are accurate for the most part, although misused words may occasionally appear; technical language or jargon may be overused or inappropriately used.
- reliance on clichés and overused expressions.
- text that is too short to demonstrate variety.

## **Score 2**

- general, vague words that fail to communicate.
- an extremely limited range of words.
- words that simply do not fit the text; they seem imprecise, inadequate, or just plain wrong.
